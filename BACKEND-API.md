# BACKEND API CONTRACT

This contract governs the exachange of data between frontend and backend parts of the system.

- Only POST requests are processed. Others are ignored either silently or with message.
- Textual data is exchanged in JSON format.
- Authentication method used is JWT sent as `Authorization: Bearer ` header.
- Unless stated otherwise, all requests on the api methods are expected to have authorization header.
- All json data fields are required, unless stated otherwise.
- All responses from api contain `ok` field. It is a boolean value and indicates success/failure.
- If `ok` field is `false`, it means the request didn't succeed. In that case there will be an 
    accompanying `message` field containing detail.
- All api requests dealing with content be preceeded by setting a profile. Without setting a profile,
    a user can not access content.
- When a user is registered, authenticated or set new profile, a new JWT is generated. The client
    should save the token to use with subsequent requests. In case token is lost,
    `authenticate` must be called to have new token issued.

CAUTION: Exact address of endpoint may differ depending on server document root when deployed.
