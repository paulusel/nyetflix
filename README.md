## Nyetflix

Nyetflix is a movie(generally any video) streaming website mimicking the popular Netflix platform. Its
name too is intended to sound similar, obviously.

This repo houses the source code for progressing work on this website. This project is aimed to be 
practicing ground and also a school project. **This is highly WIP right now**.

If you are interested in contributing code to this repo, consult `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. Also `BACKEND-API.md`
and `backend/database.sql` files may be of interest.

As of now, this repo has only static sites serving as mockups on frontend side(backend has a lot more done to it).
